#Customer Segmentation and Profiling Project
Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation and profiling using a dataset of bank transactions. The goal is to segment customers based on their transaction behavior and other attributes, providing insights that can inform marketing and business strategies.

#Project Structure
#Data Preparation:

Load the dataset from a CSV file.
Check for missing values and handle duplicates.
Convert date columns to datetime format.
Remove rows with potential data errors.
#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Calculate Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) metrics.
Create additional features like age-based and gender-based segmentation.
Visualize customer segments using various plots and charts.
#Customer Segmentation:

Use K-Means clustering to segment customers based on RFM scores.
Visualize customer segments in 3D space.
Perform segmentation based on age and gender.
Segment customers based on transaction behavior and shopping patterns.
#Optimal Cluster Selection:

Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.
Apply K-Means clustering with the chosen number of clusters.
#Cluster Analysis:

Analyze cluster characteristics by examining the mean RFM values for each cluster.
